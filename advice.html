                <p>The Toyota Corolla has stood the test of time for years. It's Ross's ultimate choice for
                    the everyday driver who just needs transportation from A to B. With a high mpg and enough

                    with a 6-speed transmission giving you the intense pleasure of driving. There's nothing that
                    can be top such a powerful machine and you'll get every inch of your money out of this beauty.</p>
